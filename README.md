***Assignment 2***
A simple linux backdoor that can run remote commands and sends the encrypted results back to the sender. It hides its process name using the most common name for both the top and ps/htop commands.

***Assignment 3***
A DNS spoofer in Ruby.

***Final Project***
A more comprehensive linux backdoor. It hides its process names, watches directories for specific file types which can be sent back to the client though covert channels, dynamically add or remove watches, has remote code execution capabilities, only accepts commands for a authenticated source (though port knocking). Done in Python.
